# Project Title

## Version A + B

This version combines the improvements and features from both Version A and Version B of the project. It integrates the necessary setup, structure, and functionality that are required for the current release.

### Key Changes:

#### Changes from Version A:
- **Initial Setup:**
  - Set up the basic project structure.
  - Defined the core configuration and setup steps for the project.
  
- **Authentication Helper:**
  - Added a password strength helper function `isStrongPassword()`.
  - Made changes to enhance password validation.
  
#### Changes from Version B:
- **API Updates:**
  - Introduced a basic health check API endpoint (`getHealth()`).
  - Added a `getUsers()` API endpoint (stub, to be connected to the database in future versions).
  
- **Database Connection:**
  - Implemented a placeholder `listRoles()` function for user roles (stub for future database integration).

- **Documentation Improvements:**
  - Updated the README file to include more comprehensive details about the project features and usage.

### Next Steps:
- **Authentication:** Add client-side validation for login form.
- **Database:** Replace the in-memory database with a persistent storage solution (e.g., SQLite or MongoDB).
- **API:** Integrate real data into the `getUsers()` API endpoint and validate inputs.
